In the early years, the Abandoned Mine Lands program focused on the physical reclamation of hazards affecting coalfield communities. More recently, the Program began working to reclaim the vitality of communities left impoverished and degraded by past coal mining. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act balances the need to protect the environment from the adverse effects of surface coal mining with the Nation's need for coal as an essential energy source. It ensures that coal mining operations are conducted in an environmentally responsible manner and that the land is adequately reclaimed during and following the mining process."

  description: "In response to the Deepwater Horizon blowout, explosion and resulting oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, the Department of the Interior launched the most aggressive and comprehensive reforms to offshore oil and gas regulation and oversight in U.S. history. This included restructuring to provide independent regulatory agencies that have clear missions and are better resourced to carry out their work, while keeping pace with a rapidly evolving industry. These efforts help ensure that the United States can safely and responsibly expand development of its domestic energy resources."

  description: "This memorandum transmits the results of the OIG’s final evaluation report on oil and gas leasing in Indian Country. The review concluded that Indian oil and gas leasing is not achieving its full economic potential. Numerous problems contribute to a general industry preference to conduct business on private, Federal, and state lands before considering Indian lands. Indian landowner frustration with some of these conditions has led to legal action against BIA. The OIG found, however, that improving Federal oversight could help stimulate oil and gas development on Indian lands."

  description: "The first American Indian Day was celebrated in May 1916 in New York. Red Fox James, a Blackfeet Indian, rode horseback from state to state, getting endorsements from 24 state governments, to have a day to honor American Indians. In 1990, President George H.W. Bush signed a joint congressional resolution designating November 1990 as National American Indian Heritage Month. Similar proclamations have been issued every year since 1994. This Facts for Features presents statistics for American Indians and Alaska Natives, as this is one of the six major race categories."
